                   <h3>The Project:</h3>
                    <p>Cal State Fullerton and CSUF's Extension Programs partnered with Boeing to provide Boeing employees with certificate and degree programs.  
                    </p>
                    <p>The original site needed a heavy redesign and improve the user experience of the overall navigation of the site. The client also wanted equal emphasis for campus degrees and certificate programs.</p>

                    <p>We also cleaned up the language and navigation so that it wasn't confusing for  employees to find the course they were looking for</p>
                    <p>The majority of Boeing users were using IE8, so the new redesigned site would have to work for both IE8 and modern browsers. </p>
                    <p>Boeing also wanted data to see how many of their employees were making use of these programs. </p>

                   <h3>The Concept:</h3>
                        <p>We wanted a fresh and more bold look to the site. But still keeping it simple enough to navigate and easily understand the programs offered by Cal State Fullerton. There was a lot of duplicate info on the current site and clunky navigation. We wanted the registration pnrocess to be more fluid and less work for the employee.  </p>
